@namespace _qjsonserializer_helpertypes

In case your custom types cannot be passed to the generic methods of the serializer, you may need to provide additional helper types.

Do so by providing additional specialisations for:

- is_serializable
- json_type

Have a look at the already existing specialisations as basis.
